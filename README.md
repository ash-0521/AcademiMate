# AcademiMate
The primary objective of developing the AcademiMate chatbot is to address the significant challenges faced by University students who encounter obstacles in acquiring essential information regarding various aspects of university life, ranging from COVID-19 pandemic-related updates to orientation, transfer credits, enrollment procedures, student tuition, fee assistance, academic majors, scholarships, student loans, financial aid, housing options, meals, tutoring services, and more.
AcademiMate's development journey was accelerated by the integration of state-of-the-art AI technologies in the Azure Language Studio AI framework. The pivotal role of Natural Language Processing (NLP) through tools like QnA Maker and Language Studio. This robust NLP foundation laid the groundwork for a more intelligent and user-friendly interaction.
